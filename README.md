# Documentation:
[Gitbook - fivem-appearance](https://wasabirobby.gitbook.io/wasabi-scripts/scripts/fivem-appearance)


# Requirements:
- es_extended
- esx_identity
- ox_lib
- esx_multicharacter (Rework)
- **REMOVE** esx_skin resource
- **REMOVE** skinchanger resource

# CFG Load-Order:
- ox_lib
- es_extended
- esx_identity
- fivem-appearance
- esx_multicharacter (No Guarantee it works without my Reworked version!)


# This Fork is Tested and used with a Custom version of esx_multicharacter:
- I do NOT Guarantee that this Works without esX_multicharacter because i made Changes in client/client.lua upon Character-Creation with NOT Choosing Peds.
- Because this is Roleplay i really Recommend to Restrict any User by using any Ped like zombie-alien-etc! It WILL be abused. thats why i deactivate the Ped-List
- As an Admin you are still able to use /skin ID command. But Yes. I THINK! this is only an Admin Feature... So like it or not ^^
